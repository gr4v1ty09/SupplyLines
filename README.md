# Supply Lines

**Minecolonies × Create**

Supply Lines is a Minecolonies/Create mod that allows players to supply their colonies with items from Create mod factories!

Instead of forcing everything into a single storage system, Supply Lines lets your colony **request items from player-built Create logistics**, making large-scale factories and rail networks feel like a natural extension of your settlement.

***

## What Does Supply Lines Do?

Supply Lines adds a **new Minecolonies building and job** that acts as a supply bridge between your colony and external production.

*   Colonists request items in their normal fashion
*   The Stock Keeper fulfills those requests if no one else in the colony can
*   Items can come from **standard storage** or **Create Stock Networks**, depending on building level
*   Couriers pick up items and deliver as usual

***

## Blueprint-Based Behavior

Supply Lines uses **Structurize blueprints** to define how the building functions.

Blueprints determine the physical layout of the structure and how items can enter the Stock Keeper’s racks.

*   Items arrive only through connections defined in the blueprint (belts, chains, frogs, etc…)
*   Racks accept items as defined by the blueprint. (funnels, unpackagers, etc…)
*   The Stock Keeper interacts with the building as it exists in the world

Just like Minecolonies style packs, SupplyLines blueprints can be custom tailored to your world!

## Building Progression

The Stock Keeper's building evolves as your colony grows:

### Levels 1–3: Colony Storage

*   Requests are fulfilled using items placed in the building’s racks
*   Works like a specialized Warehouse
*   Great for early and mid-game colonies

### Level 4+: Create Supply Network

*   The Stock Keeper can request items from a **player-configured Create stock network**
*   Requested items are staged at pickup points
*   Couriers collect items just like any other delivery

> You design the belts, trains, depots, and factories — Supply Lines handles the colony side.

## Development Status

Supply Lines is currently in **Alpha**.

This means features may change, balance is still being refined, and rough edges are expected. While care is taken to avoid issues, early builds can still cause unexpected behavior.

As with any mod in active development, it’s strongly recommended to:

*   Back up your worlds regularly
*   Test updates in a separate instance when possible
*   Expect breaking changes between versions

Use at your own discretion — and thank you for helping shape the mod through early testing and feedback.

Happy building, and keep those Supply Lines running! 🚂
